"""
- Is it possible to use the `pytsk` library to analyze an existing filesystem
  (such as an ISO, raw disk image, or virtual hard drive) and determine the
  slack space a file at a known path on the filesystem, and if so, how?
  Furthermore, can the location of this slack space be determined so that a
  direct edit of the relevant bytes can be performed?
  
- Suppose that I am only interested in identifying the physical offset of a
  file's clusters, as well as determining if a file has any slack space.
  How might I achieve that using the pytsk library? Please provide a Python
  script in as much detail as possible.
  
- Can you modify this script to indicate the expected physical offset of the 
  beginning of slack space for the file as part of `print_file_runs()`?
